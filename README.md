# Hi, I am Amrit 👋

I am a CS & systems engineering sophomore at [KIIT University](https://kiit.ac.in/)

I started my coding career from class XI from C++. Computers and technology always attracted me towards itself. In my childhood days I always used to wonder how these websites are created and handled, how big companies like Google and Facebook is managed etc. These several thought pushed me towards my dream to become a Computer engineer.

### What I am up to right now 👨‍💻 

* I am trying to do some competitive coding in C programming language.

### What I am currently learning 😁

I am trying to get better at the whole domain of web development. Practising MERN stack. 

I am fascinated towards ML so I am just trying to learn ML basics now.
